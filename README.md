**# SE_GROUP_Thu1**

GitHub repositry for Software Engineering Group Thursday 1

**Team members:**

Callum Glass (project manager), Arda Bariskan, Oliver Walker, Justin Wylie

**Things to think about:**

There is now a working version of the app which can be found in the main branch. Simply create a version of this on your device and ensure that you have all of the neccesary extentions installed in vs code then run the app and it should run succesfully.

If working on a feature for the app a new branch should be created to do so then this can merged into the main branch with a pull request. This will ensure that the main branch always contains a fully working version of the app and no code that is broken.
